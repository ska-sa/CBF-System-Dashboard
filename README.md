# CBF-System-Dashboard

## 1. Dash

### What is Dash?

#### Dash is a Python framework for building analytical web applications. No JavaScript required.

Build on top of Plotly.js, React, and Flask, Dash ties modern UI elements like dropdowns, sliders, and graphs directly to your analytical python code.

To learn more about Dash, read the [extensive announcement letter](https://medium.com/@plotlygraphs/introducing-dash-5ecf7191b503) or [jump in with the user guide](https://plot.ly/dash).

### Documentation

View the [Dash User Guide](https://plot.ly/dash). It's chock-full of examples, pro tips, and guiding principles.

## 2. Node-RED
This project entails how Node-RED Dashboard is ran under Docker which shows the systems status and any relevant information. 

![CBF Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ska-sa/CBF-System-Dashboard/master/images/dash.png)

This project uses a modified version of Node-RED `nodered/node-red-docker`
container on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nodered/node-red-docker/).


## Building Image

Build the docker image with the following command, which will also install all dependencies...

        $ docker build -t cbf-dashboard/cbf-system-dashboard .

## Startup container
To run the newly build docker container, execute the following command...

        docker run -h "${HOSTNAME}" --name=cbf-sys-dash --restart=on-failure:10 -p 1880:1880 cbf-dashboard/cbf-system-dashboard

Let's dissect that command...

        docker run      - run this container... and build locally if necessary first.
        -h "${HOSTNAME}" - run container with system hostname
        -p 1880:1880    - connect local port 1880 to the exposed internal port 1880
        --name cbf-sys-dash - give this machine a friendly local name
        --restart on-failure:10 -  the container will be restarted only if it stops
                                   with an exit code other than 0. (0 is for normal
                                   shutdown.)
        cbf-dashboard/cbf-system-dashboard - the image to base it on


Running that command should give a terminal window with a running instance of Node-RED

You can then browse to `http://{host-ip}:1880` to access the Node-RED editor(Requires authentication)

![Dashboard auth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ska-sa/CBF-System-Dashboard/master/images/login.png)

and  `http://{host-ip}:1880/ui` to access the Node-Red CBF Dashboard with additional links to select from...

![Dashboard menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ska-sa/CBF-System-Dashboard/master/images/menu.png)

### Container Shell

        $ docker exec -it <containerID> /bin/bash

Will give a command line inside the container - where you can then run the npm install
command you wish - e.g.

        $ cd /data
        $ npm install node-red-node-smooth
        node-red-node-smooth@0.0.3 node_modules/node-red-node-smooth
        $ exit
        $ docker stop <containerID>
        $ docker start <containerID>

Refreshing the browser page should now reveal the newly added node in the palette.

## Running headless

The barest minimum we need to just run Node-RED is

    $ docker run -d -h "${HOSTNAME}" --name=cbf-sys-dash --restart=on-failure:10 -p 1880:1880 cbf-dashboard/cbf-system-dashboard

This will create a local running instance of a machine - that will have some
docker id number and be running on a random port... to find out run

![Docker ps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ska-sa/CBF-System-Dashboard/master/images/images.png)


You can now point a browser to the host machine on the tcp port reported back, so in the example
above browse to  `http://{host ip}:1880`



### User Permission Errors

If you are seeing *permission denied* errors opening files or accessing host devices, try running the container as the root user.

```
docker run -it -p 1880:1880 --name mynodered --user=root nodered/node-red-docker
```
